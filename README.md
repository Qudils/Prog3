# Prog3
Student Secretariat in Java

## Description:
Our university group project for the Programming 3 exam was a collaborative effort centered around Java programming. 
We leveraged various design patterns to enhance the structure and scalability of our codebase,
although the specifics of these patterns remain undisclosed. Our development environment primarily revolved around Eclipse IDE for Java Developers, 
offering a robust set of tools for coding, debugging, and version control. Additionally, 
we utilized SceneBuilder to streamline the creation of graphical user interfaces, facilitating seamless integration of front-end components with our Java backend. 
For database management, we employed MySQL Workbench, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval processes within our application.
